Fork Join Test
==============

Some code to show how **fork-join** framework from Java 7 is working.

The code is from http://www.javabeat.net/simple-introduction-to-fork-join-framework-in-java-7/ , thanks for the author.

And I also use normal `ExecutorService` to write it, but can't tell the difference.

What's the main point of the fork-join framework?
